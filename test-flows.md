  -b cookies.txt

# 3. GET specific resource
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/resources/resource-1 \
  -b cookies.txt

  -b cookies.txt

# User with 'write' scope
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/resources \

## 4. Token Refresh Flow

### Flow 4.1: Automatic Token Refresh

  -b cookies.txt

# 3. Wait for access token to expire (24 hours) or manipulate JWT
# 4. Try to access resource again - should auto-refresh and succeed
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/resources \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### Flow 4.2: Expired Refresh Token
